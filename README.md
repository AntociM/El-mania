- Product page

- Shopping cart page

![](static/media/readme-images/wireframes-shopping-bag.jpg)

Some design changes come up during the development process.

## Site Structure

The application has some main pages: Home, Products, Product-detail page, Profile, Shopping Cart, Checkout, Terms of sale, Open purchase, Privacy Policy. It also has several additional pages related to Admin and accounts.

## Design Choices

The design is modern and straightforward, with a sharp edge. The main goal is to maintain client's focus on shopping and to be as intuitive as possible, making client's interaction with the website fast and simple.
### Color Scheme

The color pallet has contrasting and vibrant colors. The red and green accents are used as intuitive visual hints for `delete` and `add to cart` buttons, as well as to display discounted prices and badges.

![](static/media/readme-images/pallets.jpg)

## Data Model

El-mania's website is based on the MVC model (Model. View and Controller). It consists of a database with relationships between models (represented by tables in the above image). The models are User, Item, ItemDiscount, CartItem, Order, OrderItems, and Contact. The views then render the models in a way dictated by the URLs.

Some fields have been altered during the development process, and new models have been created: UserProfile and UserContact.

Each product is presented on a card with an image on the left side, name, and rating in the middle, and on the right-side unit price and two options: `Add to cart` and `Details`.

To complete these actions, the user must click on `Show results`. The matching results are displayed. `Clear filters` will remove the selected filters.

#### Checkout

- **Shipping Address** is an order form that the user must fill out to proceed to payment. Here a website's guest can fill up the name, email, telephone, address, city, postal code, county, and country (select from the list).

   An authenticated user can select from his registered shipping address.

If an order is under this amount, a delivery fee of 10$ will be applied. *Total* is the sum of the order total and delivery fee.

#### Profile

An authenticated user has access to his profile. The profile page has three dropdown sections.
- The first section includes a form where a user can save default **shipping details**(e.g, home address, office, or another place where wishes to receive orders). This information will appear on the checkout without needing to complete the checkout form.
    The user can update or delete one registered address.

![](static/media/readme-images/registered-address.jpg)

- The second section is **Order history**. A user can see the order number, status, order date, delivery address, and order summary for each order.

- The 3rd section gives the user the possibility to change his password. `Change Password` will redirect to the reset password page, and the user will receive instructions via email.

![](static/media/readme-images/order-history-1.jpg)

#### Contact form

Contact form includes name, email, telephone, title, and message. When a user submits a contact request, the application logs the contact to the database for a record. Initially, all messages are marked as 'unreplied'. A quick reference to see the contact's status.

![](static/media/readme-images/contact-form.jpg)

#### Additional pages

The user is redirected to different pages from AllAuth accounts.

- Sign in: the user can log in using his credentials, username/email, and password. There is a link to the Sign up form in the case of a new user.
- Password reset: to recover the forgotten password.
- Email verification: every new user will receive a verification email to finalize the signup process.

#### Admin Panel

Admin has access via the default Django Admin page. The Admin panel is accessed from the navigation menu (Admin link) once a superuser has logged in. Admin can add/delete users, upload/delete products, and see the contact received via contact form. The admin can manually change the order status from `processing` to `delivered`.

![](static/media/readme-images/admin-panel-order.jpg)

### Future Feature

- Add a custom Admin interface.
- Automatic notification for the user when an order has a new status.
Possibly for the user to change upload a profile picture and change credentials.
- Order status to be more detailed. Now are available only 2.
- Information on delivery at checkout.

## Generating Fixtures

The product data in the database is created by uploading pre-written data from a file using fixtures in JSON format. To read and filter the dataset using Python, conversion of JSON into their respective Python objects was needed.

## SEO Implementations

To improve accessibility for El-mania, a series of techniques were implemented:

- `meta` tags description, keyword
-  added xml-sitemap and robots.txt
-  added alt tags for `img`

## Marketing

To increase visibility for potential clients, El-mania is using Social Media Marketing. This presents the advantage of being free of charge and offers the possibility of creating close relationships with customers.

El-mania has a Facebook business page, as presented in the image above. The link to the page can be accessed from the footer, Facebook icon.
Facebook is the most popular social media platform, with a significant representation worldwide. They are also offering the possibility of paid ads, which aligns with El-mania's marketing strategy for the future.
