The El-mania project has two apps: store and shopping_cart.
## Store app

This app contains the products list, item model, and product_page.html. The sorting and filtering of the products.

## Shopping_cart

This app includes the products added by the customer to the shopping cart and the placement of order. The OrderItem and Order models. Shopping_cart_page and checkout_page are located in the cart's templates.




# Testing

## Generating Fixtures

The products data in the database is created by uploading pre-written data from a file using fixtures in JSON format. To read and filter the dataset using Python, conversion of JSON into their respective Python objects was needed.
