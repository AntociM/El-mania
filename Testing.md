### Responsivness

The responsive design tests were carried out manually with Google Chrome DevTools.

### Compatibility

The website was tested on Chrome, Edge, Mozilla Firefox. The functionality and appearance remain unchanged between these three on any device size.
### Manual Testing

The testing targeted especially form fields input.

1. Validation was added to the **order form**, where the user fills out his personal information.

- full name, city, country  fields validate only alphabetical characters and space.
- address field must contain only alphanumeric characters.
- phone number is validating only numbers, with a standard format.
When a user clicks `Payment` button, the validation error messages are displayed.

2. **Shipping information** form has the same validation criteria for phone, address, city, and county. An error message is displayed in the left corner for the user to check the form.

Future improvements in these forms can be instant validation, so the user can see the error before the entire form is filled.

3. The adjust quantity button on the shopping cart page does not validate a negative input. An info message is displayed.

4. The `min` field for the price filter on the products page does not validate negative values, and `max` price must be greater than the minimum price input.
